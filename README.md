CoronaCheck is a personal project of mine I am currently working on. The purpose of the application is to give an overview of current COVID-19 statistics across the world. Users can view either worldwide data or individual country data using the Overview screen or the Map view. The app is designed to have a clean and clear UI and to be easy to use.
The main reasons for creating this application are to build and improve upon my existing knowledge and skillset, learn new technologies, and to create something that is current and apt in today's circumstances.

## Key Technologies Used

* Networking calls using RESTful APIs
* Dark Mode
* UICollectionView with Diffable Data Source
* Card View using UIPropertyViewAnimator
* MapKit
* CoreLocation
